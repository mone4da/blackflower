helloball service is a proof of concept, 
to demonstrate how easy is to develop a service for blackflower.

We are running a dart based socket.io server, which is behind, 
so, as first step install an older version of socket.io-client

npm install socket.io-client@2.0.2

then
- claim your key and password
- edit the config.json with the key and password obtained
- run node index.js
- last but not least ... have fun with blackflower

cheers
The team
